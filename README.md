Overview

Over the past two decades, there has been a monumental shift in how people access and consume video content. With the universal access to broadband internet, numerous platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and HBO Go emerged and steadily grew to prominence. Although not a household name in itself, OTT is the exact technology that made the streaming revolution possible.
OTT stands for “Over The Top” which refers to any video streaming service delivering content to the users over the internet, however, there are subscription charges associated with the usage of such platforms such as PrimeVideo, Netflix, HotStart, Zee5, SonyLiv, etc. But choosing your next movie to watch can still be a daunting task, even if you have access to all the platforms.
